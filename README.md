# Trase

## Description 

`Client 1`: Roger <br>
Roger wants company X to develop a website for his new company.

Roger has the opportunity to <u>profit</u> from this investment. He can improve business credibility, enhance online presence and expand market reach/coverage among many other profitability opportunities.

Roger primarily wants deadlines to be met and the work to be of top quality. 

`Client 2`: Rafael <br>
Rafael needs company Y to deal with a legal case that he is stuck in. He has no other choice but to seek professional aid. 

Rafael <i>does not</i> have any opportunity to profit from this investement. 

Along with high quality work, <b>Rafael wants to see the time and cost of each task that is done in his case.</b>

`Value Propositon` <br>
By leveraging the Kanban ideology, Trase <b><i>automatically</i></b> manages the time and cost of each task done by company Y in Rafael's case.
